# malkit
Full malware Kit


README in development, will be updated shortly.

To test, first create a new environment (best practice). I testes it on a full Anaconda environment.
Tested on python 3.7+ (doesn't work on 3.8 yet). Probably works on 3.6

Then install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)

For now, the functionality that is the same as Chromepass exists as the following:
python malkit.py build_chromepass --email --address yourEmail@domain.com

where the email is the one you want to receive the logs at.
